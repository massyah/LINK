LINK: Latent Inference of NetworKs
========================================

LINK is a tool to infer and analyze networks reprensenting signaling pathways. LINK is based on 
1. a _background interactome_ (a network of all known PPIs)
2. _a corpus_: the textual content of published documents annotating the PPIs of the interactome

To infer networks, LINK receives as input _a seed_, conisting of a starting seed of proteins and/or description of interactions between them. Interactions can be provided either as 
1. Edges from the backgroun interactome
2. PMIDs corresponding to documents annotating PPI
3. Free text
